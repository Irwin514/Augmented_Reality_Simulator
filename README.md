# Augmented_Reality_Simulator

The project will involve the development and documentation of a significant C++ programming application related to the material in this course.  Students are encouraged to develop an application related to their previous work or current interests in mechanical, industrial, or aerospace engineering.
 
Lecture Topics

I) Object Oriented C++ Programming

1. Encapsulation
Classes and member functions
Constructors and destructors
2. Polymorphism
3. Inheritance
	4. Pointers and dynamic memory allocation
5. Software development techniques (design, debugging, testing, documentation, etc.)

II) Programming Applications

1. Modelling and simulation of mechanical systems
	State-variable equations
Numerical simulation
2. Introduction to machine learning and neural networks
	Function approximation and optimization
	Computing neural networks
	Training neural networks
3. Additional topics (DirectX 3D graphics, multi-threaded programs, microcontroller programming, mechatronics, robotics, artificial intelligence, signal processing, network communication, etc.)

Students are also encouraged to perform additional readings and self-study on other topics related to their project (ask the instructor for suggestions).

Note: In the event of extraordinary circumstances beyond the University's control, the content and/or evaluation scheme in this course is subject to change.


COURSE LEARNING Outcomes (CLOs)
Upon successful completion of MECH 415, the students will be able to:
1) Understand the usage of C++ syntax including classes, constructors, destructors, and overloading.
2) Understand advanced C++ programming topics including pointers, shared memory, communication, binary file I/O, 3D graphics, and real-time simulation.
3) Debug and test programs using symbolic debuggers.
4) Apply the C++ topics listed above to solve problems including numerical simulation, real-time simulation, virtual reality, machine learning, signal processing, mechatronics, and optimization. 
5) Design and implement functions and classes to develop modular object oriented programs.

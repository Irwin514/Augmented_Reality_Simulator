Course Outline:
MECH 472  Mechatronics and Automation

The project is a proof of concept of Real-time Data from an Accelerometer (MPU-6050) controlling the servo-motors of a real size flight simulator. 
The accelerometer is a device that measures the acceleration, RATE OF CHANGE of the velocity of the microchip. It has the following sensing features: Gyroscope, acceleration in meters per second square (m/s^2), motion processing and clocking capabilites. 

We successfully demonstrated that a life size flight simulator can be controlled with an IMU acceleremeter that can ultimately be install inside a moving drone, RC car or any moving vehicule. The sensing device could remotely give Real-time Flight simulation sensations to the pilot in the flight simulator.


For this projects, the following topics were used to:
I) Object Oriented C++ Programming

1. Encapsulation
Classes and member functions
Constructors and destructors
2. Polymorphism
3. Inheritance
	4. Pointers and dynamic memory allocation
5. Software development techniques (design, debugging, testing, documentation, etc.)

II) Programming Applications

1. Modelling and simulation of mechanical systems
	State-variable equations
Numerical simulation
2. Introduction to machine learning and neural networks
	Function approximation and optimization
	Computing neural networks
	Training neural networks
3. Additional topics (DirectX 3D graphics, multi-threaded programs, microcontroller programming, mechatronics, robotics, artificial intelligence, signal processing, network communication, etc.)

Students are also encouraged to perform additional readings and self-study on other topics related to their project (ask the instructor for suggestions).

Note: In the event of extraordinary circumstances beyond the University's control, the content and/or evaluation scheme in this course is subject to change.


COURSE LEARNING Outcomes (CLOs)
Upon successful completion of MECH 415, the students will be able to:
